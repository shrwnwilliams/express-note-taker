# express-note-taker
# Description
This is the finalized version of my express note taker. The user will be presented with a landing page and, when they click the link on the home page, they are presented with the notes page. Previously made notes will be displayed on the left and they can input new notes and save them on the right. Unfortunately, due to a miscommunication with my tutor, i was unable to properly make it so, when saving a note, it would automatically display on the left (though they do show up on reload), nor could I make it so the notes were editable. Furthermore, deleting works the same way, on click, they are not removed immediately, but on page refresh they do disappear.
